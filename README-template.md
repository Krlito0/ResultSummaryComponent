## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learn to be more sure with my tools like the inspector to fix some bug or understand what i have to fix.
I learned to manipulate the color hsl, hsla and the linear gradient to have a nice template.


### Continued development

Now I don't have a section where i am not comftable with, so i think i ll continue to play with all of the tools i know.


### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/) - Like usual this site help for all things about the web langage.
